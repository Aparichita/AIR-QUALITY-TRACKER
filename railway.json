# Railway deployment configuration

Your backend is ready for Railway deployment. Just:

1. Connect your GitHub repo to Railway
2. Railway will auto-detect Node.js
3. Set environment variables:
   - AQI_API_KEY
   - OPENAI_API_KEY (optional)
   - MONGO_URI (optional)
   - FRONTEND_URL (your frontend domain)
   - NODE_ENV=production

4. Railway will automatically deploy!

Note: Railway auto-sets PORT, so no need to configure it.
